To install these files type ./INSTALL from this directory.
The necessary files will be copied to paramesh/mpi_source.
You can then compile as you normally would.

This files provide checkpointing functions for PARAMESH using the hdf5
library.  You will need to have some version of hdf5 installed on your
system.  The routines here have been tested using hdf5 version 1.6.2.

The install script calles the INSTALL.py script so you will also need
python on your system.  

The install script tests your system using 'uname' to determine what kind
of system you have.  It then write a file 'underscore.h' which defines
a C preprocessor flag which will insert (or not) underscores to the
C functions called by the Fortran code.  The only systems we have
tested Paramesh on which don't require underscores are IBM and the 
Mac OSX running Absoft's Fortran compiler.  If your system has different
requirements, then you will need to edit the C code yourself and add 
underscores in the proper way.
