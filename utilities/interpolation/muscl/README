This directory contains files necessary to perform the prolongation operation
using a 'MUSCL' interpolation scheme.  A complementary restriction
operation is not provided.

To use these routines, copy 

amr_1blk_cc_prol_user.F
amr_1blk_cc_prol_work_user.F
amr_1blk_fc_prol_user.F

into the paramesh/source directory and copy 

paramesh_interfaces.F

into the paramesh/headers directory.  Then, recompile paramesh.

Also, you must set interp_mask_unk, interp_mask_work, or interp_mask_facex,y,z
to be equal to 20 in your application.
